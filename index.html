       <h1 class="title">I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud</h1>
	   <h3 class="odd">
	      I wandered lonely as a cloud <br>
          That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br>
          When all at once I saw a crowd,<br>
          A host, of golden daffodils;<br>
          Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>
          Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br>
	   </h3>
	   <h3 class="even">
	      Continuous as the stars that shine <br>
          And twinkle on the milky way,<br>
          They stretched in never-ending line <br>
          Along the margin of a bay:<br>
          Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
          Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br>
	   </h3>
	   <h3 class="odd">
	      The waves beside them danced; but they <br>
          Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br>
          A poet could not but be gay,<br>
          In such a jocund company:<br>
          I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
          What wealth the show to me had brought:<br>
	   </h3>
	   <h3 class="even">
	      For oft, when on my couch I lie <br>
          In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
          They flash upon that inward eye<br>
          Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>
          And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
          And dances with the daffodils.<br>
